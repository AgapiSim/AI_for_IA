The present repository contains four documents:

    * Autoencoders_AI_for_IA.pdf: The presentation that was presented in the course in the format of a pdf file.

    * Autoencoder_Grade_3.ipynb: The code utilized for the first part of the assignment is based on the article AutoEncoders: Theory + PyTorch Implementation by Syed Hasan, 2024. This file is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Alterations and additional code for plotting and further evaluation have been applied compared to the initial code presented in the article.

    * Autoencoder_opt_Grade_3.ipynd: Similar approach as in Autoencoder_Grade_3.ipynb but with the difference that a deeper bottleneck layer was employed, with 8 versus 2 previously used neurons. For the latent space representation, PCA was applied for dimensionality reduction.

    * Autoencoder_time_series_Grade_4_5.ipynb: The code for the second part of the assignment is based on the article Hands-on Time Series Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders, with Python by Piero Paialunga, 2024.his file in the form of a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.Alterations and additional code for plotting and further evaluation have been applied compared to the initial code presented in the article.

All .ipynb files were created and run using Google Colab, in December 2024.
